/*
 * Write a program to print Fibonacci Series up to 10?
 * 
 * Fibonacci Series: The Fibonacci Series in Java is a set of numbers where every number is the sum
 *                   of the two numbers before it.
 *                   The series starts from 0 and the following number is 1.
 *                   
 *                   Ex: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,......
